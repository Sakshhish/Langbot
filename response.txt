You can ask questions about the programming languages' characteristics like:

1. When specific languages were created (e.g., "When was Python created?")
2. Which languages use certain paradigms (e.g., "Which languages are multi-paradigm?")
3. Typing system questions (e.g., "Which languages are statically typed?")
4. Comparative questions (e.g., "What are the differences between Java and Python?")
5. Questions about languages created in specific years (e.g., "Which languages were created in 1995?")

To test the chatbot, try asking any of these questions.
